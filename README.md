# Real-World Object Recognition App

## Overview

This iOS application utilizes Swift to implement object recognition through photos taken with the device's camera. The core functionality is powered by the MobileNetV2 model, enabling accurate and rapid identification of various objects in the real world.

## Features

- **Camera Integration:** Instantly capture photos within the app for object recognition.
- **MobileNetV2 Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained model for efficient and accurate object recognition.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Provides instant feedback on recognized objects from captured images.

## Installation

To use this application:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/t0nysantiago/ObjectRecognition.git`
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the application on a compatible iOS device or simulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your iOS device.
2. Grant necessary permissions for camera access.
3. Point the camera at an object and take a photo.
4. Receive real-time feedback on the recognized object and its details.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift:** Programming language used for app development.
- **CoreML:** Integration of the MobileNetV2 model for object recognition.
- **UIKit:** Interface elements and design of the iOS app.
- **Vision:** Apply computer vision algorithms to perform a variety of tasks on input images and video.
